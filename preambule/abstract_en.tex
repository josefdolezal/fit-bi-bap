Bachelor thesis aims to create an application to control 3D printers.
The application simplifies control of 3D printers from devices running iOS operating system.
An important part of the solution is the ability to control multiple printers simultaneously, which is not currently supported either from applications or web interface.
Application is available as open source to allow community to possibly add new functions in the future.
